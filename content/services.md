<div class="services-intro">

We deliver **end-to-end algorithmic solutions** — from research spike to production deployment. Every engagement is scoped to a clear deliverable, a fixed timeline, and measurable success criteria.

## Computer Vision Pipelines

Custom vision systems engineered from the ground up — not fine-tuned demos, but **production-hardened pipelines** built for your specific domain.

| What We Deliver | How |
|:---|:---|
| **Object Detection & Segmentation** | Foundation-model-assisted labeling (Florence-2, SAM) → custom-trained architectures tuned to your data |
| **Visual Anomaly Detection** | Statistical and learned approaches for industrial QA, security, and compliance |
| **Video Analytics** | Real-time tracking, counting, and event detection on live streams |

**Typical outcome:** A containerized inference service with documented API, tested against your acceptance criteria, ready for integration.

## Edge AI Optimization

You have a model that works on a GPU server. You need it to run on a **phone, a drone, or a $20 board** — without losing the accuracy that matters.

| Technique | Target Hardware |
|:---|:---|
| **Quantization** (INT8 / FP16) | Mobile SoCs, embedded Linux |
| **Pruning & Distillation** | Android (Kotlin), Jetson, IoT gateways |
| **Architecture Search** | Custom silicon, FPGA, DSPs |

**Typical outcome:** Same model, 4–10× faster, deployable on the hardware you've already committed to.

## Generative AI Research

When your problem isn't classification but **generation, simulation, or distribution modeling**, we bring the mathematical depth required to move beyond prompt engineering.

| Domain | Architectures |
|:---|:---|
| **Synthetic Data Generation** | Diffusion Models, GANs, VAEs |
| **Complex Distribution Modeling** | Normalizing Flows, Score-based Models |
| **Structured Output Generation** | Constrained decoding, grammar-guided sampling |

**Typical outcome:** A validated generative pipeline with quantitative evaluation metrics, reproducible training, and a path to production.

## Engagement Models

<div class="engagement-grid">

**📋 Project-Based**
Fixed scope, fixed price. Ideal for well-defined deliverables — a proof-of-concept, a model optimization pass, or a production pipeline.

**🔄 Retainer**
Ongoing advisory and engineering support. Best for teams that need a senior algorithmic engineer on call without a full-time hire.

**🧪 Research Sprint**
Two-to-four-week deep dive into a technical question. Produces a written report with code, benchmarks, and a go/no-go recommendation.
