<div class="services-intro">

We deliver **end-to-end algorithmic solutions** — from research spike to production deployment. Every engagement is scoped to a clear deliverable, a fixed timeline, and measurable success criteria.

</div>

## Computer Vision Solutions

Custom vision systems engineered from the ground up — not fine-tuned demos, but **production-hardened pipelines** built for your specific domain.

<div class="service-details">

- **Object Detection & Tracking** — Real-time detection, multi-object tracking, and counting on live video streams using custom-trained architectures
- **Image Segmentation** — Pixel-level semantic and instance segmentation for medical imaging, industrial inspection, and geospatial analysis
- **Auto-Labeling Pipelines** — Foundation-model-assisted annotation (Florence-2, SAM) that cuts labeling costs by 10× while maintaining quality
- **Visual Anomaly Detection** — Statistical and learned approaches for industrial QA, security, and compliance applications
- **Video Analytics** — Event detection, behavior analysis, and real-time alerting on edge and cloud deployments

</div>

**Typical outcome →** A containerized inference service with a documented API, tested against your acceptance criteria, ready for integration.

## Edge AI Optimization

You have a model that works on a GPU server. You need it to run on a **phone, a drone, or a $20 board** — without losing the accuracy that matters.

<div class="service-details">

- **Quantization** — INT8 and FP16 conversion with accuracy-aware calibration
- **Model Pruning** — Structured and unstructured pruning to remove redundant parameters
- **Knowledge Distillation** — Training compact student models from larger teacher networks
- **Architecture Search** — Finding optimal network architectures for your specific latency and memory constraints
- **Runtime Optimization** — ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, and platform-specific compilation for maximum throughput

</div>

**Typical outcome →** Same model, 4–10× faster, deployable on the hardware you've already committed to.

## Generative AI & LLM Solutions

From retrieval-augmented generation to custom model pipelines — we bring the **engineering depth** required to move beyond demos into production-grade AI systems.

<div class="service-details">

- **RAG Pipelines** — End-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems with optimized chunking, embedding strategies, and retrieval accuracy tuning
- **In-House LLM Deployment** — Self-hosted large language models for data-sensitive environments — fine-tuning, quantization, and inference optimization
- **Synthetic Data Generation** — Diffusion Models, GANs, and VAEs for training data augmentation and simulation
- **Complex Distribution Modeling** — Normalizing Flows and Score-based Models for scientific and financial applications
- **Structured Output Generation** — Constrained decoding and grammar-guided sampling for reliable, schema-compliant LLM outputs

</div>

**Typical outcome →** A validated AI pipeline with quantitative evaluation metrics, reproducible results, and a clear path to production.

## Engagement Models

<div class="engagement-grid">

**📋 Project-Based**
Fixed scope, fixed price. Ideal for well-defined deliverables — a proof-of-concept, a model optimization pass, or a production pipeline.

**🔄 Retainer**
Ongoing advisory and engineering support. Best for teams that need a senior algorithmic engineer on call without a full-time hire.

**🧪 Research Sprint**
Two-to-four-week deep dive into a technical question. Produces a written report with code, benchmarks, and a go/no-go recommendation.
