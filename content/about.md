## Who We Are

**Don Shaked Algorithmic Consultant LLC** is a boutique engineering practice that turns cutting-edge AI research into production-grade systems.

We work at the intersection of **mathematical rigor** and **shipping code** — where a published paper becomes a deployed pipeline, and a prototype becomes a product that scales.

### The Principal

Don Shaked is a **Senior Algorithmic Engineer** with deep roots in the Israeli defense-tech and computer-vision ecosystem. He has designed and shipped vision systems for environments where failure is not an option — real-time surveillance, mobile edge devices, and industrial inspection at scale.

His focus: the **"hard" problems** that pre-trained models and AutoML cannot solve. When accuracy requirements are non-negotiable, latency budgets are measured in milliseconds, and the hardware is fixed — that's where we come in.

### Technical DNA

We don't just *run* models — **we engineer them**.

<div class="service-details">

- **Research & Prototyping** — Python · PyTorch · OpenCV · NumPy
- **Production & Mobile** — Kotlin · Android · ONNX Runtime · TensorRT
- **LLM & GenAI** — RAG pipelines · Fine-tuning · Self-hosted inference
- **Philosophy** — Mathematical correctness first, then memory efficiency, then inference speed

### How We Work

<div class="value-grid">

**🎯 Precision Over Volume**
We take on a small number of engagements at a time. Every project receives principal-level attention — no hand-offs to junior engineers.

**🔬 Research-to-Production**
We bridge the gap between what works in a Jupyter notebook and what works at 30 fps on a $50 device.

**🌐 Global, Lean Operations**
Headquartered in the US with operations in Medellín, Colombia — seamless EST/CST overlap for American and Israeli clients at competitive rates.
