## The Firm

**Don Shaked Algorithmic Consultant LLC** is a boutique engineering practice that turns cutting-edge AI research into production-grade systems.

We work at the intersection of **mathematical rigor** and **shipping code** — where a published paper becomes a deployed pipeline, and a prototype becomes a product that scales.

### The Principal

Don Shaked is a **Senior Algorithmic Engineer** with deep roots in the Israeli defense-tech and computer-vision ecosystem. Over the past decade he has designed and shipped vision systems that run in environments where failure is not an option — from real-time surveillance to mobile edge devices.

His specialization: the "hard" problems that pre-trained models and AutoML cannot solve. When accuracy requirements are non-negotiable, latency budgets are measured in milliseconds, and the hardware is fixed — that's where we come in.

### Technical DNA

We don't just *run* models — **we engineer them**.

| Capability | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Research & Prototyping** | Python · PyTorch · OpenCV · NumPy |
| **Production & Mobile** | Kotlin · Android · ONNX Runtime · TensorRT |
| **Philosophy** | Mathematical correctness first, then memory efficiency, then inference speed |

### How We Work

<div class="value-grid">

**🎯 Precision Over Volume**
We take on a small number of engagements at a time. Every project receives principal-level attention — no hand-offs to junior engineers.

**🔬 Research-to-Production**
We bridge the gap between what works in a Jupyter notebook and what works at 30 fps on a $50 device.

**🌐 Global, Lean Operations**
Headquartered in the US with operations in Medellín, Colombia — providing seamless EST/CST time-zone overlap for American and Israeli clients at competitive rates.
